## Installation
Use the package manager npm to install the dependencies for each folder by navigating to the desired project folder in the terminal using the following command
```
npm install
```
## Autocomplete
This app acts as a search bar that auto fills suggested search terms that the user may be thinking of. In this case, the items are countries, so country names that match the query will display below.
## Color Flipper
This app has two functions, the first, called "Simple", generates a random color selected from an array of values. The second, called "Hex", generates a true random hex color.
## Countdown Timer
As the name suggests, this app is a countdown timer for an event or date in the future. It leverages clock time to determine the time shown.
## Counter
This basic app has three buttons to increment, decrement, or reset the counter value dislayed on the screen back to 0. A green value indicates positive, while red indicates negative.
## Filter List
Similar to the autocomplete, this search bar displays potential values, but vanish if the search term no longer matches the item name. This app checks if each word contains the string of letters as opposed to starting with that string of letters.
